This piece is the first chronological post in my "blog".

I don't believe that my online texts should ever really be "done". 
Every time I tried to set up a blog, I had a short burst of motivation for a couple of posts,
followed by abandonment as life took over and I lost the will to make complete posts.

Now that life has slowed down, I can focus on cultivating a space rather than presenting a piece.

I was
inspired by [Joel Hook's article on digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden):

- A garden is usually a place where things grow.
- Things are organized and orderly, but with a touch of chaos around the edges.
- If you visit the root of this site you'll notice that you are welcomed with a small "best of" selection and a few other topics that I wanted to surface for you because they are interesting to me and I'd like to share them with you.
